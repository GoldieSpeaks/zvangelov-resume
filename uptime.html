            <p> Ulties had reached out to me in order to seek my expertise on this project. The idea here was for us to create something that would compete on the global market and beat all of our competitors's features and pricing models. The product was aimed towards being "UNIQUE" and standing out from all competitors. </p>

            <h3 style="text-align: left; font-size: 28px; color: white;">My Roles</h3>
            <p> For this project, i had the task to play multiple roles, basically everything excluding the development work. Given my skill set I was able to perform flawlessly within all roles and we managed to create a very good work flow and speed. Covering so many bases solely did increase the delivery times, but we were able to hit a fairly descent timeframe for delivery.</p>
            <p>Ofcourse, I had assistance where needed from the guys at Ulties and we were taking group decisions at the end of the day.</p>

                <h3 style="color: white;">Product Owner</h3>
                <p>In my capacity as a Product Owner, I was tasked with breaking down the project into sprints using agile methodologies and devising a delivery plan. To streamline task management, we opted for TRELLO, avoiding unnecessary resource allocation on software such as Jira.</p>

                <h3 style="color: white;">Business Analyst</h3>
                <p>In my role as a Business Analyst I was tasked with delving into the market and doing research in terms of competitors, I had to make sure that our app was covering all the features that our competitors had, had a better design both WEB and Mobile. The skilled development team @Ulties amde sure that we could develop and cover all the features our competitors had.</p>

                <h3 style="color: white;">UI/UX Designer</h3>
                <p>In order to cut down on spending I proposed to take care of the User Experience and UI Design, taking in account my years of experience as a UI/UX Designer it would ahve been a shame to outsorce the design to a third party company, Ulties did not have a dedicated Designer to work with, so I had to take the role.</p>
